Explainability in Credit Risk Machine Learning

Using a synthetic dataset generated by combining publicly available credit risk data (FICO-xML-Challenge, Lending Club, and Give me Some Credit), we evaluate two general tree-based model specifications: 

* A constrained XGBoost
* An extension of XGBoost with Random Forests as base learners

We benchmark these models against a state-of-the-art credit scoring method, WOE Logistic Regression (WOE LR), using performance metrics such as the Gini and calibration score (1 - ECE).
Our aim is to demonstrate that tree-based modeling methods are indeed suitable for credit scoring when appropriately configured and effectively communicated. Our contribution to the field of credit risk modeling lies in changing the perception of tree-based models from being seen as unsuitable for the task at hand to becoming the industry standard for assessing consumer credit risk.
